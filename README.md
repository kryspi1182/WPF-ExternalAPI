# WPF-ExternalAPI
Simple program used to manage objects (CRUD) via an external API, written in WPF (.NET)

TODO:
Popup window while waiting for API operations to finish.
Speed up operations (ExecuteAsync work really fast but sometimes fails, either use that and add a repeat mechanism, or use something else)
